# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
## WTWR Back-End Project
### Overview
The WTWR Back-End Project is dedicated to creating a robust server for the WTWR application. This project will provide you with valuable insights into working with databases, implementing security measures, conducting testing, and deploying web applications on remote servers. The ultimate objective is to develop a fully functional server complete with an API and user authorization.
